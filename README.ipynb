    "## Question 1: How much should you spend to make a successful movie?\n",
    "This portion of the analysis was done with the data in `Movie Budgets`. After determining there were no duplicate entries, I cleaned the data by reformatting the monetary data and changing some datatypes. I removed dollar signs and commas from monetary columns and converted their datatype from `object` to `int`. I also converted release date data to date-time objects, from which I extracted the year to create a `release_year` column. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was to adjust for inflation (in `budget`, `worldwide_gross`, and `domestic_gross`), as I was dealing with historical monetary data. This was done with the CPI library and the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "`movie_budgets_df['budget_adjusted'] = movie_budgets_df.apply(lambda x: cpi.inflate(x.production_budget,   x.release_year), axis=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "I then calculated the domestic and worldwide return on investment (ROI), creating new columns for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "`movie_budgets_df['roi'] = (movie_budgets_df['wwgross_adjusted'] - movie_budgets_df['budget_adjusted']) / movie_budgets_df['budget_adjusted']`\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to create a new categorical variable, budget classes, for my spending analysis, and used the `qcut` method for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`bin_labels = ['Low', 'Low Medium', 'High Medium', 'High']\n",
    "budgets_adjusted_df['budget_class'] = pd.qcut(budgets_adjusted_df['budget_adjusted'], q=[0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1],   labels=bin_labels, precision=0)`\n",

    "## Outlier Discussion\n",
    "Any performance outliers in this analysis come from `tn_movie_budgets_gz`, as this file contains all the monetary information used in this project. Decisions on what to do with these outliers impact my analyses of other variables, like which genres seem to be the most profitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to examine the outliers for both ROI and profit (worldwide), creating separate dataframes for each.\n",
    "I used the following interquartile range method to acquire a dataframe for these outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "`budgets_adjusted_df = budgets_adjusted_df.sort_values(by='profit', ascending=True)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Q1 = np.quantile(budgets_adjusted_df['profit'],0.25)\n",

    "profit_outlier_df = budgets_adjusted_df[outliers_low | outliers_high]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROI outliers\n",
    "45% of the ROI outliers come from the Low Budget class. 26% and 19% come from the Low Medium and High Medium classes, respectively. Lower budget films do seem to have higher ROIs, which makes sense given the smaller budgets (smaller divisor in our ROI formula). A boxplot from my preliminary visualization confirms this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Profit outliers\n",
    "Most of the profit outliers (70%) come from the High Budget category. The mean budget for High Budget profit outliers is around 67 million, so these profit outliers are not necessarily a result of extremely high budgets (the upper end of the High Budget category, which gets up to 513 million).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution for outliers\n",
    "For the rest of the analysis, I decided to throw out the Low Budget class (under 7.8 million), which contains the bulk of the ROI outliers anyway. I also assumed that Microsoft would risk spending more than 7.8 million on a new film in order to make more money per film. Microsoft would likely be interested in budgets that correlate with higher profits than what low budget films can typically muster up. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, I decided to include the profit outliers for my remaining questions. The Numbers has made this note on their budget data: \"Budget numbers for movies can be both difficult to find and unreliable. Studios and film-makers often try to keep the information secret and will use accounting tricks to inflate or reduce announced budgets\" https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all. Because it is difficult to tell if the profit outliers are true outliers, and because Microsoft would be interested in what factors may make up an extremely profitable film, I have decided to include them.

    "- **Gather more monetary data (budgets and gross information).** Many titles with monetary data from The Numbers could not be matched with titles present in IMDB's database (which contained info on genres, actors, and directors). More monetary data could improve the accuracy. \n",
    "- **Model rates of production.** Microsoft would benefit from knowing what its long-term movie output should be, or how many titles to release per month or per year.\n",
    "- **Look at other measures of success.** This analysis uses ROI as a measure of success for all categorical variables, like genres, actors, and diretors. Results may differ through using profit or gross figures instead.\n",
    "- **Limit budget investigation to only recent releases.** For most other parts of this analysis, films were limited to releases after 2000. We live in an increasingly interconnected world, and this may affect the relationship between domestic and world wide ROI + profits.\n",
    "- **Examine trends and practices for other movie studios.** More investigation can be done as far as what makes a successful movie studio, as opposed to what contributes to successful film releases."
